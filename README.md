# Reinforcement-Learning-Agent_Frozen-Lake
Reinforcement learning project. Creating an Agent which core will be a neural network that produces the policy. The policy is represented as a probability distribution over actions. We improve our policy by playing a few games and then adjusting our policy - we user Cross entropy method.
